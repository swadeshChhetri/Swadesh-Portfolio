                <strong>Full-Stack Developer | Bengaluru, India</strong>
              </h3>
              I am a passionate and hardworking Full-Stack Web Application
              Developer with hands-on experience in building real-world web
              solutions.
              <br />
              I specialize in creating responsive, user-friendly applications
              using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Laravel, Next.js,
              TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
              <br />
              I have successfully developed and deployed a Company Finance
              Management Portal, showcasing my ability to handle end-to-end
              project development and deliver impactful results.
              <br />
              Additionally, I gained valuable industry exposure through a
              Full-Stack Development internship with a Tamil Nadu-based company.
              <br />
              Currently, Iâ€™m working at a Bengaluru-based startup, where I
              contribute to both front-end and back-end development.
              <br />
              I thrive in collaborative environments and love turning creative
              ideas into efficient, scalable solutions.
              <br />
              My goal is to build meaningful applications that solve real-world
              problems and bring value to users and businesses alike.
